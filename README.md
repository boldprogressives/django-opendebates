django-opendebates
=============

# Installation

Install python 2.7, virtualenv, postgres.

```
createdb opendebates
virtualenv --python=python2.7 ve
./ve/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
./ve/bin/python opendebates/manage.py makemigrations registration
./ve/bin/python opendebates/manage.py syncdb
./ve/bin/python opendebates/manage.py load_zipcode_database ./zips.csv
```

Then you can start the development server:

```
./ve/bin/python opendebates/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

## Site copy and content

We're relying on Django's i18n system for managing site copy.  An "English translation"
should be generated and used to provide installation-specific text, rather than updating
messages directly in the codebase.

To that end, all user-visible strings
in the Python and Django template files are wrapped in Django's i18n functions, and can
be collected into a .PO file with Django's built-in manage.py commands:

```
sudo apt-get install gettext
cd opendebates
../ve/bin/python manage.py makemessages -l en
```

This will give you an up-to-date file in
`opendebates/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/django.po`
which you can edit with installation-appropriate text overrides.  To use it, then run:

```
../ve/bin/python manage.py compilemessages -l en
```

You can visit the view at `/test/` to confirm that text overrides are working properly.

## Deployment

There is a management command `manage.py update_trending_scores` --
in production, you'll want a cronjob
to run that every ten minutes (or more, or less) and may want to adjust
the "trending algorithm" which is expressed in SQL.

Deployment-specific environment variables can be stored in a `opendebates/.env` file.
See `opendebates/.env.sample` for relevant variables that you might want to set.

To install front-end packages and then collect static files:

```
./ve/bin/python /vagrant/opendebates/manage.py bower install
./ve/bin/python opendebates/manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

Files will be collected into `opendebates/static/` -- in production mode (DJANGO_DEBUG=False) 
all static files will be served from this directory.  Do not make edits to files directly
in `opendebates/static` -- instead, make edits to the source files (usually that's in opendebates/opendebates/static) and then re-run collectstatic
to update the served copies.


## Using Vagrant to create dev VM

### Installation
Install virtualbox. This will be fairly OS specific, but we recommend using some package manager (apt/aptitude, rpm, brew, etc). Unless you're on windows, in which case ???

Install vagrant: http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html

Install vagrant plugin vagrant-ansible-local
   vagrant plugin install vagrant-ansible-local

### Setup
All you should need is `vagrant up`. This will bring up a VM with all of the appropriate setup/installation.

In order to get into the VM, you can use `vagrant ssh`. This will log you in as the 'vagrant' user, which has sudo priveleges. If you'd like root, you can use `sudo su -` which will log you in as root. All of the files in repo will be placed in /vagrant.

Therefore, in order to start the webserver, you can do the following:
```
/vagrant/ve/bin/python opendebates/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Similarly, to collect static files you can use:
```
/vagrant/ve/bin/python /vagrant/opendebates/manage.py bower install
/vagrant/ve/bin/python opendebates/manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

HOWEVER, you don't actually need to ssh into the VM in order to run these commands!
```
vagrant ssh -c '/vagrant/ve/bin/python /vagrant/opendebates/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000'
```
or
```
vagrant ssh -c '/vagrant/ve/bin/python /vagrant/opendebates/manage.py bower install'
vagrant ssh -c '/vagrant/ve/bin/python /vagrant/opendebates/manage.py collectstatic --noinput'
```


You do not need to edit any of the server files in the virtual machine. It is perfectly fine to do all of your normal development work in this repo as you would normally.

### Create a Superuser
```
vagrant ssh -c '/vagrant/ve/bin/python /vagrant/opendebates/manage.py createsuperuser'
```
or if already inside the VM:
```
/vagrant/ve/bin/python manage.py createsuperuser
```

# Developing

## Front-End

One of the key principles we'd like to keep in mind across the site is separation of concerns. 
We want to make each piece as much dedicated to one concern as possible. 

One example where this is particularly relevant is javascript in django template files. 
We want to keep javascript out of our django template files as much as possible. 
There may be some situations in which it may be necessary to have some small amount of js, particularly if we need to pass python variables to the front end,
but if you find yourself doing any logic work in an inline javascript snippet in a django template file, please please put that into its own js file.

Similarly, we want to keep html templating out of any javascript files.
If you find yourself doing something like this:
```
$('.some-container').append('<h1>A header</h1><p>A message</p><p>Another message</p>');
```
Move that html into a javascript template!

### Structuring

We're using LESS compiled to CSS, Handlebars templates, and a handful of third-party libraries including jquery, lodash, momentjs, and bootstrap amongst some others.

We use django templates to hand off any server configs to javascript. We can do this by creating a javascript namespace which can be accessed from any other included JS files.

See /opendebates/templates/base.html for an example of how this works. Similarly, we can then access that namespace in any of our javascript files. 
An example of loading that namespace is in /opendebates/static/js/base/helpers.js

With our javascript namespace, we can order all of our submodules, with their properties and functions, and any of their sub-modules. 
Our namespace is `ODebates`, so we might have: `ODebates.paths`, `ODebates.configs`, `ODebates.login`, etc.

If we had a login page, we could have an object `ODebates.login`, which could then have a function `ODebates.login.init()`, an object `ODebates.login.helpers` for helpers that
are specific to that login page, `ODebates.login.handlers` for any handlers which are specific to that login page, etc.

### Bower

Bower is a front-end package manager:
http://bower.io/
https://github.com/nvbn/django-bower

It makes keeping track of front-end libraries/dependencies much simpler and less error-prone. Instead of randomly saving js or css files from 3rd party websites, bower lets us
keep all of our dependencies in one place, track versions and handle updates. 

In our settings.py file, we have the following:
```
BOWER_INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'jquery',
    'lodash',
    'bootstrap',
    'moment',
    'handlebars',
)
```
These are bower packages with their names as they might appear here: http://bower.io/search/

If you'd like to add an additional package, search for it on bower, add a line here to our settings file, and then run:
`vagrant ssh -c '/vagrant/ve/bin/python /vagrant/opendebates/manage.py bower install'`
`vagrant ssh -c '/vagrant/ve/bin/python /vagrant/opendebates/manage.py collectstatic --noinput'`

In order to use one of these libraries in a django template, you can use the following:
```
  {% load static %}
  <script type="text/javascript" src='{% static 'jquery/dist/jquery.min.js' %}'></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src='{% static 'handlebars/handlebars.min.js' %}'></script>
```

### LESS Stylesheets

We're using django-pipeline for LESS->CSS compilation. 
http://django-pipeline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html

In our settings.py file, there is a variable PIPELINE_CSS = {} which sets up the stylesheet pipeline.
An example might look like:
```
PIPELINE_CSS = {
    'base': {
        'source_filenames': (
          'less/base.less',
        ),
        'output_filename': 'css/base.css',
        'extra_context': {
            'media': 'screen,projection',
        },
    },
}
```

What this does is takes base.less, compiles it, minify/uglifies it (if not in DEBUG), and put the result into /static/css/base.css.
You can then load that stylesheet with the following:
```
  {% load pipeline %}
  {% stylesheet 'base' %}
```

Which leads us into
### Bootstrap 

Ideally, we'd like to work with Bootstrap, not fight against it. 
Bootstrap provides for the setting and accessing of a variety of LESS variables, which we would ideally match with our graphic design palette.

For example, in static/bower_components/bootstrap/less/modals.less, there is the following code:
```
// Actual modal
.modal-content {
  position: relative;
  background-color: @modal-content-bg;
  border: 1px solid @modal-content-fallback-border-color; //old browsers fallback (ie8 etc)
  border: 1px solid @modal-content-border-color;
  border-radius: @border-radius-large;
  .box-shadow(0 3px 9px rgba(0,0,0,.5));
  background-clip: padding-box;
  // Remove focus outline from opened modal
  outline: 0;
}
```
By setting `@modal-content-bg` in our variables.less file, we can change the modal background color in the most bootstrap-compatible (read: least hacky) way.

For any page that we'd like to import bootstrap styles (and our bootstrap variables), you can add the following to the top of the page:
`@import "bootstrap_import";`
### Handlebars

Similarly to how the css pipeline works, the javascript pipeline is set up like so:
```
PIPELINE_JS = {
    'base': {
        'source_filenames': (
          'js/base/*.js',
          'templates/base/*.handlebars',
        ),
        'output_filename': 'js/base.js',
    }
}
```

Then in the django template, we just need to call the following to load our compiled js
```
  {% load pipeline %}
  {% javascript 'base' %}
```

This will load any of the javascript files in static/js/base/ and will load and compile any handlebars templates in static/templates/base/

In our javascript, we could then access any of our named handlebars templates with `Handlebars.templates['template_name']` where template_name.handlebars
was a template file.


# Misc Vagrant+Ansible

## Useful Commands
see http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/cli/index.html

`vagrant provision` - runs the ansible playbook set in the Vagrantfile
`vagrant ssh` - ssh into the VM
`vagrant reload` - reloads the Vagrantfile and makes any changes necessary. Adding `--provision` will run the ansible provisioner after reload

## Watch mode

The following will run the ansible provisioner in "watch" mode so that you can see if any changes would be made:
```
vagrant ssh -c "ansible-playbook /tmp/vagrant-ansible-local/django_server.yml --connection=local -i 'localhost,' --check --diff"
```
